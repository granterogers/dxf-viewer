- **Tabbed viewing** — open multiple DXF files side by side with close buttons
- **Drag and drop** — drop any `.dxf` file onto the window to open it
- **Smooth pan & zoom** — mouse-wheel zoom centred on cursor, click-drag to pan
- **Fit to window** — press `F` to fit the drawing to the viewport instantly
- **Directory navigation** — step through all DXF files in a folder with `◀` / `▶` or arrow keys
- **Always on top** — pin the window above other apps for reference while working
- **System tray icon** — lives in the tray while running; right-click to open files or exit
- **Remembers last folder** — file picker reopens where you left off
